# Document RAG System
A full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built with Python, FastAPI, and Google Gemini.

## 🚀 Features
- **Document Ingestion**: Helper support for PDF, DOCX, and TXT files.
- **RAG Pipeline**: Semantic search using ChromaDB and answer generation via Google Gemini.
- **Modern UI**: Dark-themed dashboard with status monitoring.

## � Milestones

### Milestone 1: Document Ingestion & Indexing
- **Objective**: Build a robust data pipeline for processing and indexing documents.
- **Tasks**: Select and set up a vector database; develop scripts for document ingestion and text splitting; generate and store document embeddings.
- **Evaluation Criteria**: The document ingestion and indexing pipeline is operational, and documents can be successfully embedded and stored in the vector database.

### Milestone 2: RAG Pipeline Development
- **Objective**: Implement the core Retrieval-Augmented Generation logic.
- **Tasks**: Integrate the retrieval mechanism with the vector database; connect to an LLM API; develop the logic for synthesizing answers from retrieved chunks and citing sources.
- **Evaluation Criteria**: The RAG pipeline is functional, and the system can retrieve relevant document chunks and generate coherent, grounded answers.

### Milestone 3: Conversational Interface & Dialogue Management
- **Objective**: Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.
- **Tasks**: Design and implement a web-based chat interface; Ensure the system can handle multi-turn conversations and maintain context.
- **Evaluation Criteria**: The web interface is responsive, supports file uploads, and enables natural language interaction with the RAG pipeline.

### Milestone 4: Deployment & Final Evaluation
- **Objective**: Deploy the full system and conduct a comprehensive evaluation.
- **Tasks**: Deploy all components to a hosting environment; conduct final performance and accuracy testing; generate a report on system performance and usability.
- **Evaluation Criteria**: The system is containerized, performance metrics are documented (Ingestion/Retrieval), and the system is ready for production use.
